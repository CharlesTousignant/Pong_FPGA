# Pong on an FPGA with VHDL

A simple pong game using a [Basys 3 Artix-7 FPGA](https://digilent.com/shop/basys-3-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-introductory-users/).


# Project description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Input
A joystick with 2 potentiometers (only one is used) controls the paddle movement. A simple voltage divider takes the 5V supplied by the Pmod ports and gives a range of 0V to 1V from the potentiometer, that is then read by the analog-to-digital converter on the FPGA. Then only other input is the center push button (BTNC), that acts as a reset.

## Ouput
The game is displayed on a monitor through VGA output. The score is displayed on the 4-digit 7-segment display onboard the FPGA. The score of the player on the bottom screen corresponds to the two left-most digits, the remaining ones for the player on top.

## Code
Most of the code was written entirely by me, though I based my vga output controller on the example on [Digilent's GitHub](https://github.com/Digilent/Basys-3-GPIO/blob/master/src/hdl/vga_ctrl.vhd). I also used [this tutorial](http://www.unilim.fr/pages_perso/vahid/XADCinBasys3.html) to get the ADC IP working. Finally some bits of code were taken from material from my INF3500 class at Polytechnique Montr√©al (given my Pierre Langlois), comments in the code indicated which parts those are.

## About the project
This project was something I had in the back of my mind during my numeric systems design and creation class. It was a great learning experience. Not only did I get to further develop my skills in coding VHDL and using an FPGA, I also learned how a VGA signal works, and how to generate one.


## Future work
There are a few things that I would like to add to this project eventually. The first being a proper second player input, since currently one joystick is used to controll both players. Having a video output now allows for other exciting things, such as generating a Fractal in real-time, to add an interesting background to this game. I'll update this project if these things come to fruition.
