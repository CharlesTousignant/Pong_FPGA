# Pong on an FPGA with VHDL

A simple pong game using a [Basys 3 Artix-7 FPGA](https://digilent.com/shop/basys-3-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-introductory-users/).


# Project description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Input
A joystick with 2 potentiometers (only one is used) controls the paddle movement. A simple voltage divider takes the 3.3V supplied by the Pmod ports and gives a range of 0V to 1V from the potentiometer, that is then read by the analog-to-digital converter on the FPGA. Then only other input is the center push button (BTNC), that acts as a reset.

## Ouput
The game is displayed on a monitor through VGA output. The score is displayed on the 4-digit 7-segment display onboard the FPGA. The score of the player on the bottom screen corresponds to the two left-most digits, the remaining ones for the player on top.

## Code
Most of the code was written entirely by me, though I based my vga output controller on the example on [Digilent's GitHub](https://github.com/Digilent/Basys-3-GPIO/blob/master/src/hdl/vga_ctrl.vhd). I also used [this tutorial](http://www.unilim.fr/pages_perso/vahid/XADCinBasys3.html) to get the ADC IP working. Finally some bits of code were taken from material from my INF3500 class at Polytechnique Montr√©al (given my Pierre Langlois), comments in the code indicates which parts those are.

## Running the project
- Connect the ground to pin JA1, and the variable voltage from a potentiometer(max 1V) to JA7. 
- Connect the monitor with vga cable to the FPGA board.
- After connecting the FPGA board to a computer via USB, navigate to the /src directory in command line. The tcl commands in [this file](src/Pong.tcl) should be put in the vivado command line, in mode tcl. This can be done by running "your_path_to_vivado_bin_folder/vivado -mode tcl" once in the correct directory. 
- To start the game, press the BTNC push button.

## Future work
There are a few things that I would like to add to this project eventually. The first being a proper second player input, since currently one joystick is used to control both players. Having a video output now allows for other exciting things, such as generating a Fractal in real-time, to add an interesting background to this game. I'll update this project if these things come to fruition.
